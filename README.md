# SynRM-Design
Rotor design calculation sheet for slot/poles: 24/4; 36/6; 48/8 etc.
Rectangular Flux barriers considered.
Reference: Synchronous Reluctance Machine Design : KTH
The design of SynRM, specially rotor, may involve several iterations. The sheet quickly calculates geometry parameters that can be entered into simulation software. It reduces effort involved in each iteration. 

It can be included with stator design to make it a complete tool or the same stator as an Induction motor can be used.
